# Data-Analyst
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of the courses I have completed and the exercises I have worked on, with a primary focus on data analysis. It is designed to document my learning journey, consolidating theoretical knowledge and practical applications in one organized space.

Within this repository, you will find structured materials, code implementations, and key insights gained throughout various courses. Each section includes hands-on exercises, real-world case studies, and coding projects that reinforce my understanding of essential data analysis techniques and tools. Additionally, a significant part of my learning involves ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, where I work on extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it into a structured format, and loading it into databases or analytical systems.

The goal of this repository is not only to track my progress but also to serve as a reference for future projects and continuous learning. By applying best practices and working with different datasets, I aim to refine my skills in data manipulation, visualization, ETL workflows, and interpretation, ensuring a strong foundation for more advanced topics in analytics.
